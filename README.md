# nicerpy_xrayanalysis
Personal suite of programs for X-ray analysis of NICER Data 

v1 - January 14 2019 

- To create light curves, pulse profiles, color diagrams, and power spectra from NICER data

v2 - June 3 2019 

- To create light curves, pulse profiles, color diagrams, and power spectra from data processed through NICERsoft. Also edited Lv2_lc, Lv2_ps, Lv2_phase, Lv2_color to allow NICERsoft data.

v2.1 - July 18 2019

- Creating averaged power spectra from either one observation ID, or a list of observation IDs! One has to take care of the naming scheme for the merged event files though. 

Will make a more comprehensive README in the future, but this is the current state... Can refer to the documentation!
